Revert to a specific release version master branch Quotes Contributions Communities Spacemacs Everywhere License Supporting Spacemacs README philosophy for whom screenshots documentation contribute achievements FAQ Quick Start If you don have an existing Emacs setup and want to run Spacemacs as your configuration and if you have all prerequisites installed you can install Spacemacs with one line shell git clone https Windows PowerShell git clone https If HOME is not set in environment or in registry git clone https If you do have an existing Emacs configuration look at the full installation instructions for other options Introduction Spacemacs is a new way of experiencing Emacs -- it a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics mnemonics and consistency Just clone and launch it then press the space bar to explore the interactive list of carefully-chosen key bindings You can also press the home buffer button for some great first key bindings to try Spacemacs can be used naturally by both Emacs and Vim users -- you can even mix the two editing styles Being able to quickly switch between input styles makes Spacemacs a great tool for pair-programming Spacemacs is currently in beta and any contributions are very welcome Features Great documentation access the Spacemacs documentation with SPC h SPC Beautiful GUI you love the distraction free UI and its functional mode-line Excellent ergonomics all the key bindings are accessible by pressing the SPC or Alt-m Mnemonic key bindings commands have mnemonic prefixes like SPC b for all the buffer commands or SPC p for the project commands Batteries included discover hundreds of ready-to-use packages nicely organized in configuration layers following a set of conventions Documentation Comprehensive documentation is available for each layer by pressing SPC h SPC You can also check the general documentation quick start guide and the FAQ Getting Help If you need help ask your questions in the Gitter Chat and a member of the community will help you out If you prefer IRC connect to the Gitter Chat IRC server and join the channel Last but not least there are a lot of high class tutorials available on YouTube Jack of Some Spacemacs tutorial videos GDQuest Game Design oriented tutorials to Spacemacs Practicalli Clojure tutorials based on Spacemacs Eivind Fonn classic Spacemacs ABC Prerequisites A package manager if the OS doesn have one already Spacemacs is an extension of a popular text editor called Emacs So you need Emacs installed first Spacemacs requires Emacs 27 or above The development version of Emacs is not officially supported but it should nevertheless be expected to work git is required to download and update Spacemacs Tar either GNU Tar or BSD Tar is required to install and update Emacs packages used by Spacemacs The default font used by Spacemacs is Source Code Pro You may customize your own font settings and choose another font If you want to use this default font it must be installed Spacemacs also uses fallback fonts to ensure certain Unicode symbols it uses symbols appear correctly The fonts used are determined by the OS Linux Nanum Gothic macOS Arial Unicode MS Windows MS Gothic and Lucida Sans Unicode If the mode-line doesn look similar to the picture at the top of this page make sure you have the correct fallback font installed Various commands in Spacemacs needs one of the following line searching program ripgrep The silver searcher The platinum searcher ack GNU Grep or BSD Grep Grep is very slow but it widely available on most systems and is used as an fallback option We strongly recommend ripgrep over other line searching programs for its blazing fast speed The following subsections helps you to install it Linux Most Linux distribution ships a package manager already and if this is the case you are all set for this step If it doesn you may need to build the softwares mentioned below from their sources In most distributions Emacs is installed via an emacs package from the package manager N DO not install XEmacs because it not supported by Spacemacs XEmacs is an old fork of Emacs with various subtle differences N Some Linux distributions support only Emacs versions older than 27 In this case you should build it from source instead Very likely Git is already installed on your system Otherwise you should be able to install git from your system package manager Very likely Tar is already installed on your system Otherwise you should be able to install tar from your system package manager If Nerd Fonts and Nanum Gothic are available from your distribution package manager you should install it there Otherwise the generic way to install it is Download the latest pre-built TTF font from https and https Extract the archive and move the font files to Refresh font cache with fc-cache -fv If your distribution is listed here follow the instructions Otherwise you can download its pre-built binary or build it from source macOS The most popular package manager on macOS is Homebrew to install it /bin/bash -c -fsSL https Several options exist for installing Emacs on macOS Emacs Plus features additional functionalities over base Emacs brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus install latest stable release with Spacemacs icon and native compilation brew install emacs-plus --with-spacemacs-icon --with-native-comp Emacs Mac Port adds native GUI support to Emacs 28 And the full list of features is available here brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport brew install emacs-mac Emacs for Mac OS X is the binary build of GNU Emacs without any extra feature brew install --cask emacs To install git brew install git macOS ships with BSD Tar so you don need to install it To install Source Code Pro Font brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts brew install --cask font-source-code-pro Arial Unicode MS is shipped with macOS v10 and later so you don need to install it manually You can install ripgrep via Homebrew brew install ripgrep Windows We recommend Scoop as the package manager for Windows users You can install it via PowerShell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser Optional Needed to run a remote script the first time irm get iex Emacs can be installed in PowerShell scoop bucket add extras scoop install emacs To install git in PowerShell scoop bucket add main scoop install git Windows 10 build 17063 and later ships with BSD Tar and you won need to install it manually If you running an earlier version of Windows Tar can be installed in PowerShell scoop bucket add main scoop install tar To install Source Code Pro Font in PowerShell scoop bucket add KnotUntied_scoop-fonts https scoop install sourcecodepro MS Gothic and Lucida Sans Unicode are shipped with Windows 2003 and later so you don need to install it manually You can install ripgrep in PowerShell scoop bucket add main scoop install ripgrep Install Default Install The default installation downloads Spacemacs to the directory in your HOME directory But in the case of Windows HOME is not set out-of-box We recommend you to set it as an environment variable with the same value as environment variable HOMEPATH which usually looks like C Since Spacemacs will now be downloaded at if it already exists it be overridden Also if you have either or they will appear before Spacemacs in Emacs initialization steps Thus they must be renamed in order for Spacemacs to load correctly To backup/rename the aforementioned files/directory in shell -d mv -f mv -f mv or in PowerShell if TestPath -Path Rename-Item if TestPath -Path Rename-Item if TestPath -Path Rename-Item Now clone this repository with Git The following work for both shell and PowerShell git clone https In case you have a limited internet connection or limited speed git clone --depth 1 https Now you can launch Emacs and Spacemacs will be loaded Alternative Install Location To install Spacemacs in a different location we first need to introduce how Spacemacs is loaded When Emacs is started it looks for the init file in a deterministic way The default installation exploits it by occupying and let Emacs use it as its init file In other word in default installation Emacs find and load which is then responsible to load other files in If you want to install Spacemacs to a different location you need to make sure it loaded by Emacs in one of its init file For example if you cloned Spacemacs to and if you use as Emacs init file then the following lines in set variable to point to your Spacemacs installation location is equivalent to spacemacs-start-directory load Spacemacs initialization file spacemacs-start-directory First Launch and Configuration After cloning Spacemacs the first time when you launch Emacs Spacemacs will automatically install the essential packages it requires This step is the bootstrap Once the bootstrap packages are installed Spacemacs checks whether you have an customization file known as dotspacemacs If it already exists Spacemacs loads it as the configuration Otherwise you need to answer a few questions and Spacemacs will generate the dotspacemacs file for you If you are new to Emacs and/or Spacemacs it fine to just accept the default choices They can be changed in the dotspacemacs file later Spacemacs will download and install remaining packages it will require according to your dotspacemacs When the all the packages have been installed restart Emacs to complete the installation dotspacemacs is the configuration file for Spacemacs it self explanatory and is written in Emacs Lisp Read general documentation and quick start guide for more information In case you want to store your dotspacemacs at another location say under First set the environment variable SPACEMACSDIR to Move to In other word set SPACEMACSDIR to the parent directory of your dotspacemacs and move dotspacemacs to the said directory Spacemacs logo For Linux users create spacemacs in using this file as a reference Change the Name parameter to Name and the Icon parameter to Icon where PATH/TO/EMACSD is the path to your directory by default For macOS users you need to download the version of the logo and simply change the logo on the Dock Notes Depending on the installed version of GnuTLS securely installing Emacs packages may fail It may also fail if you have a bad internet environment In either case it is possible to install packages using emacs --insecure However be aware that this means your packages will be transferred using HTTP use at your own risk If the following error occurs after starting Emacs The directory is unsafe Fix it by changing the owner of the directory From Properties select the Tab Select the button Select the Tab Change the owner to your account name Source Stack Overflow The period before a file or folder name means that it a hidden file or folder To show hidden files and folders Press the Windows key Type File explorer options Select the View tab at the top Check Show hidden files folders and drives Click OK Update Spacemacs supports two different update schemes the default is a rolling update scheme based on the latest version of packages available This version can be found on the develop branch and is updated by a simple git pull The second method is deprecated It was a fixed version scheme which was based on a stable set of packages The latest fixed version can be found on the master branch and would show a notification when a new version is available Be warned that this method has not been updated in a long time so packages will be very old Rolling update develop Close Emacs and update the git repository git pull --rebase Restart Emacs to complete the upgrade Deprecated automatic update master branch When a new version is available a little arrow will appear in the mode-line Its color depends on the number of versions that have been released since the last update Green means that you have a recent version orange and red means that you have an older version Click on the arrow to update Spacemacs to the latest version Manual update master branch Remove the and angle brackets when you typing the lines below into your shell Make sure to also replace the text version which you are updating to with a tagged version This page lists the latest tags git fetch git reset --hard version which you are updating to Revert to a specific release version master branch To revert to a specific release version just checkout the corresponding branch For instance the following command reverts Spacemacs to version 0 git checkout origin/release-0 After updating Spacemacs manually or automatically you should also check if any updates are available for your packages On the Spacemacs Home Buffer SPC b h click RET on the Packages button or use the convenient keybinding SPC f e U Quotes Quote by ashnur feel that spacemacs is an aircraft carrier and I am playing table tennis on the deck as a freerider Quote by deuill LOVE
